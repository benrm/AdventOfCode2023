# Purpose

These are solutions for [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023/). The code is all mine but solving these problems was not necessarily a solo effort. The code is also not significantly modified from what it was when I solved it; in the interest of reusing code some functions were modified to work for both parts one and two of a day. I would like to go back over these and clean them up but I probably won't just so the solutions remain representative of the effort I put in.

# Notes

## Day 8

Up until today (excluding day 5 part 2) all of the problems have been manageable on my own. Unfortunately, although I got most of the way there myself, day 8 part 2 was spoiled for me. I had figured out the solution probably had to do with detecting cycles and mathematically figuring out when they sync up but I hadn't figured out that the input was specially crafted so that you could solve it by finding out when each loop finished and taking the least common multiple.
